1. We chose use case #2, predict the amount of passengers in a bus on a specific day
2 & 3. We chose a regression(forest) algorithm for this task. We intially completed the task with a classificationforest, but after testing with a regression-algorithm, we achieved a ~25% drop in our MAE (Mean Absolute Error) score, from 4.04 -> 3.39. Lower is better in this case.

To guess the amount of passengers on a specific day for bus *150*, edit the "year", "month", and "day" variables in the last cell

MAE (Mean Absolute Error) with test-size 0.25 and a dataset of 96 entries: **3.39** 

*Example-tree in the forest:*
